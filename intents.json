It's unrealistic to expect to be a social butterfly with numerous groups vying for your time. Satisfying social lives come in various forms, and deep, meaningful friendships can be more fulfilling than having many friends with whom it's challenging to connect one-on-one. Value the quality of your relationships rather than the number."

Avoid playing the victim role, as it can deter others from approaching you. Trust that there will always be a place for you and your unique gifts."

Memories of exclusion can trigger painful feelings, so it's beneficial to create distance from those reminders while you work through your emotions."
